Hello everyone and welcome to My_World : The Game

In this game, you are are a god who can do anything, like create mountains or
dig holes with the differents buttons in the toolbar.
Thanks to them, you can change the ground if you don't want snow anymore, or on the contrary, you can add a layer of snow.
Finally, you can reset the map to have a flat map.

When you start the game, you have a menu where you can create or load map.
To do that, type the name of the map as you wants and click on play.
   If it's a new map, it will be generate, in procedural or no, with the size
that you gave him.
   If you load map, the map will be load. You can reset the map from the menu to.

Good game ;-)
